okay so i have been wanting to get this off my chest
but not in a normal way that's just not my style @keyframes slider {
   
i wanted to do something unique so here ..... but at the same time I have a thought that who the hell will do this stupid clicking game .... but if u do have the time pls do it... it's very important to me

YOu know from the first day we met wasn't even sure that we would be friends or not...I mean u now know me well after 3-4 months now that what kind of a guy i am.... but u completely changed my perspective
and god knows how well we got together in such a short time. and as Naruto said heroes always arrive late, came in late but yet you're the bestest thing that ever happened to me in 2022.

it's kinda funny even now that sometimes I get those butterflies in the stomach when I get a txt from you🦋🦋🦋...

now i do know that this year hasn't been the easiest for you after all the shit you went through.... I am not at all experienced and I can't even imagine the pain you went through.... but i'm not here to talk about the past cause I very well know how strong you've become after all that... 
and I learnt a very important thing after one incident(i'll tell u about that) that it's better to forgive people no matter how shitty or good they were or how they treated you... there's absolutely no use to hold a grudge against someone
as long as you're happy with yourself... that's what's important

aab main point pe aate hain .... dosti krne ke baad tumse pyaar- vyaar liking-shiking ho gyi hain yaar... I really don't know this feeling it's kind of strange .... i mean I swear i've never felt like this before

i've literally never did this kind of stupid thing but free tha toh bana dia.... and I also don't know how to do THIS.... so let me accumulate all my gets and just ask you out</output>



should we get together for real(ationship)😶‍🌫️😓

now I very well know that after everything that you have been through u must have a feeling that we're better off alone and trust me when I say this I had this same feeling too... but as humans we can't stay captivated for long that's just not written in our DNA
I'm not saying that i'm perfect in any sense... u never know how a situation can change everything... i might just turn out just like any other person
But as long as I'll be aware of myself I'll try my best to keep u happy, kind, thoughtful & most importantly motivated.

so yeah this was everything that i just needed to get off my shoulder instead of dieing off it's burden... whatever you decide (whether you wanna stay friend or bring it up a notch) i'll happy because I know that my biggest failure in life would be to never try... and i know very well that i'm not a failure and neither are you
💖💖💖💕
